# 👋🏽 Hey, I’m Limirex!

Welcome to my space on GitHub 👨🏽‍💻  
I’m currently on a self-taught journey to becoming a **full-stack web developer**.  
This is where I document my growth, share my practice projects, and build cool things as I learn!

---

## 🔭 What I’m Working On

- 🚧 Learning CSS and improving my HTML skills
- 📚 Studying daily with hands-on projects
- 💻 Updating my [**Road to Full-Stack Web Development**](https://github.com/limirex/Road-to-Full-Stack-Web-Development) repo
- 🔜 JavaScript & responsive design coming next

---

## 🌱 What I’m Learning

- HTML (Forms, Tables, Semantic tags, etc.)
- CSS (Selectors, Flexbox, Layouts)
- Git & GitHub basics
- Planning to dive into:
  - JavaScript
  - Frontend frameworks (React maybe?)
  - Backend development (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
